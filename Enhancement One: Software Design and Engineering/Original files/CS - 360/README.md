**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

  •	 The primary purpose of this application was to be a inventory tracking system. It allows for access to the Inventory lists which can be updated in real time but with the security of having a user logged in and tracking how the system changes. The user can add new items, modify existing, and increase or decrease current totals. It also includes alerts and messaging when items go to zero to prevent issues.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

  •	The application has three main screens, main login, registering a new user, and the inventory list itself. There are also some pop-up screens to help with modifying items. It is user friendly and is well labeled to make the process as easy as possible. 

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**

  •	Starting off, I had really big ideas but soon realized that if I wanted an easy to use and use friendly app, I had to reduce and include only necessary elements. I think they main lesson learned is to get a foundation of what the requirements are and then add features that improve on its base.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**

  •	Every time I completed a screen or pop-up, I tested in the emulator to ensure that it function as intended and then start to connect the different screens. Ensuring to test those before moving and adding another screen. This confirmed that I was able to get everything working without having to backtrack to fix a compounding issue.

**Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

  •	My biggest issue was getting the pop-up screen to show on the original page without having to go to another screen. After some time I looked up some ways others had completed similar pop ups to get a better starting point and add in some elements that I had not even considered.

**In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

  •	I think for me it was getting the buttons to function as intended when it came to the database. The fact that every time some new registers to the application their info is stored and then is used to verify log in credentials. This seems so simple but I had a hard time getting the information to save correctly to then get called upon to check against but once it worked it was exciting to see how everything came together.
