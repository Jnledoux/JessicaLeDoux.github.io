Final project for SNHU - CS 499

# Self-Assessment

My name is Jessica LeDoux, and I have been working towards a degree in software engineering for the past two years at Southern New Hampshire University. I have a bachelor's degree in traditional art and after some time in the work force, I decided to go back and pursue a career in something that has always interested me since I was a kid. Throughout this program I have learned a plethora of new skills and concepts that have opened up a world of potential. In general, I thought I had a basic understanding of how applications work or how coding was applied but after this I can see the nuances and details that software development entails. I have used multiple different languages (python, java, C++), developed and designed full applications from start to finish, built databases to hold various elements, and even worked with web design and development.

Through all of these classes and projects I have developed a set of skills to adapt to situations and problems. I have met deadlines, worked with others to complete projects, and made mistakes that needed to be corrected. All through this process I have gain the necessary knowledge and experience to utilize in areas to meet that needs of a company. I want to move into a career field that uses software to help elevate and solve some of the problems that exist. IO think that with technology constantly hanging and evolving learning and improving my knowledge of computers and software will do nothing but help in the long term. I think understanding statistics and using databases and numbers can greatly improve how we help people in more personalized ways but at the same time know where individual problems may occur to hope to curve issues and improve situations. I just want to improve the overall situation of as many people as possible and I think by working towards technology and using it in positive ways to gain that is what my main goal is.

# Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design

I selected my application development for CS -360 Mobile Architect & Programming in February of 2025. The primary purpose of this application was to be an inventory tracking system. It allows for access to the Inventory lists which can be updated in real time but with the security of having a user logged in and tracking how the system changes. The user can add new items, modify existing, and increase or decrease current totals. It also includes alerts and messaging when items go to zero to prevent issues.

For the enhancement I wanted to go through and upgrade options to make it more visually appealing as well as more functional. I added social links to the application’s main page, refining the add item page and the edit pop up, as well as modifying it have a more cohesive color, style, and theme throughout the entire application.

I think this shows how if I was to present my final project to a client and receive feedback, then I would demonstrate how I would take the criticism and work on making the changes to meet the new needs. Other areas that are being worked on are problem solving, editing, and adjusting existing systems.

Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts

# Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

I ended up selecting the same artifact for both my first and second enhancement. Which was my application from CS -360 Mobile Architect & Programming in February of 2025. The primary purpose of this application was to be an inventory tracking system. It does all the same things as before but I wanted to increase security by using the principle of least privilege and add different users (clerk and manager) and limit the access they had in order to use the application. As well as adding many new features that improved both the design and easy of use. So, in the end the first enchantment is outdated and now the application contained within is the most current and aligns with a finished project. I include the first to show how moving through the process of modification more then the original problem may arise and the experience to adjust and address shows adaptability and perseverance. 

Show improvement and emphasis on security as well as keeping things simple but functional within the app and making and improving something that the client requires. As well as showing skills by adding features that can be beneficial to the company are add value to what they are trying to achieve.
    
Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.

# Enhancement Three: Databases

For this last artifact I selected something that I had being working on outside of school. My brother wanted an easier way to sort his cards, and I wanted to see if I could make the simplest application possible by taking simple information and adding them to a list or database. I started off on a simple excel worksheet but after seeing some people working in Tkinter, I wanted to try it and came up with the simple version 1.0 of the Sports Card App.

This shows how databases work and I found that getting databases to work within an application consistently was a little more difficult than when I gave it credit in class. So, I wanted to challenge myself to take something that didn’t have a set guideline and see if I could turn it into something more than just simple. I want to get each part working and show how by hard work and testing and reworking that it is possible to find errors and fix them and to have a working product. I added filters, made visual upgrades, sorting mechanisms, adding, deleting, and updating cards, and other elements to make the application better. I am excited to ad more and see where it can lead.

I think this will show resilience, hard work, problem solving, and debugging. Showing that no matter what the outcome I will make the effort to work through issues and do the work to get things accomplished. 
    
Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.

# ePortfolio Overall Skill Set

I want to show throughout all three of these codes reviews of the artifacts that secure coding is used. To me one of the biggest issues facing the new evolving world of technology is security and how we go about protecting users but at the same time limiting the amount of overreach by companies and governments for surveillance. I want to follow the best coding practices and make sure my code meets those standards and make them easy to read and work with later.

I think the main area that I think drives the narrative of my coding is the structure and organization of my projects. After multiple classes of coding practices being supplied I try to maintain every chance that I get, and I want to ensure that all my projects meet those standards as a minimum. I think it is beneficial when working in teams or when showing areas that you are trying to show off or even when trying to get approval for things that may not be directly available. Overall, I think knowing the basics and making sure to meet the standards will make a great starting point to learn at any situation to have a great career wherever that may be.
    
I think this will be the place that I will tell my personal but professional story of why I want to build a career in this field and why I think I could really flourish in it. I would like to show off the areas I think I can excel as well as showing that I can meet the standards that almost every job or technical area requires. I want to demonstrate my ability to work through problems and my no quit attitude as well as knowing that I am not going to know everything and I am willing to ask questions and get help where necessary in order to move things along. Overall, I think I would make a great team player, but I know when to put my head down and get work done to meet the needs of the client and company.
